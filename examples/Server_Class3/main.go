// This example shows how to create a server that can handle incoming "class 3" cip messages.
// These are messages generated in a program from a msg instruction.
// From the PLCs perspective we are just another PLC.  When it does a write request to a specific tag we accept that data
// and when it does a read we send it the data associated with that tag on our end.
//
// Because all cip messages come in on the same port, we have to support various independent messages coming in from multiple controllers.
// otherwise you'd never be able to communicate with more than one controller per computer.  As you'll see below this is actually
// fairly simple and takes advantage of the CIP routing path in a msg instruction.  All messages come to our IP address and then we split them
// up based on the cip path after that.  The example uses 1, 0 and 1,1 which equates to backplane slot 0 and backplane slot 1 respectively.
//
// If you look at the screenshots of MSG insructions in this folder you'll see how the read and write are setup.  Note that on the
// connection tab of the msg setup the path is "gologix, 1, 0" this is because there is a generic ethernet module in the IO config
// with the same address as the computer used for the screenshots.  You can just type the IP address in here instead of "gologix".
//
// Note that you won't be able to have multiple servers on a single computer.  They bind to the EIP ports on TCP and UDP so you'll need
// to multiplex multiple connections through one program.
